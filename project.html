        <p >Our project’s goal is to build an interactive web app for Intro Stats using R-shiny. 
            <br>As we all know, peer interaction is an important part of learning. Thus, we want to include some collaborative features in order to facilitate peer interactions in class. 
            <br>Our current plan is to use R-shiny and Convergence for the project.

        <p>Peer interactions are very important for learning. Through interactions, the peer can not only learn from each others’ ideas but also cultivate their teamwork skills. Sometimes, these communications and collaborations are even more helpful than tutorials or teaching. Specifically for statistics and other courses that require heavy coding, peer interactions can be meaningful in the sense that peers can look at and compare each others’ code in order to learn others’ logic. 
        <br>

        Our client is Peter Halpin, an Associate Professor at the School of Education at UNC. Our team, together with Professor Peter, aims to extend the web apps built using R-shiny to support collaborative features. Our primary goal is to make collaborations on R scripts possible. But we are also working towards other collaborative features that Google Colaboratory and Google Document have.  
        <br>
        <br>
        The finished web application will be a great tool for instructors and students in Intro Stat courses. One of our target audiences is instructors at school since instructors will find it convenient to add and manage in this R-shiny web app. Besides, students will benefit from it as well. They can go online and interactively work together on some intro stat exercises. At this epidemic time, our software makes peer interactions and collaborations possible even in the context of remote learning. In addition, our app also targets researchers since they can easily extract log data and find patterns about how students collaborate online.
